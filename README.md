# RAG_Boardgames

This repo contains the results of a project conducted using Google Colab to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation model using different LLMs and Embedding Models. The RAG is the able to answer questions about a variety of boardgames by basing its responses on a series of reviews taken from BoardGameGeek's 19M review dataset.
